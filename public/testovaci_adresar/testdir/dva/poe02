ast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
                              With such name as "Nevermore."

But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
Nothing farther then he uttered --- not a feather then he fluttered---
Till I scarcely more than muttered, "Other friends have flown before---
On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before."
                              Then the bird said, "Nevermore."

Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
Swung by seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.
"Wretch," I cried, "thy God hath lent thee --- by these angels 
     he hath sent thee
Respite --- respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;
Quaff, oh, quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!"
                              Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."

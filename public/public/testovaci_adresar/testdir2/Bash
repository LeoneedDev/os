DESCRIPTION
       Bash  is an sh-compatible command language interpreter that executes commands read
       from the standard input or from a file.  Bash also  incorporates  useful  features
       from the Korn and C shells (ksh and csh).

       Bash is intended to be a conformant implementation of the Shell and Utilities por-
       tion of the IEEE POSIX specification (IEEE Standard 1003.1).  Bash can be  config-
       ured to be POSIX-conformant by default.
